Streamlink[-27]
===============

Overview
--------

Streamlink is a :ref:`command-line utility <cli:Command-Line Interface>` which pipes video streams
from various services into a video player, such as `VLC`_.
The main purpose of Streamlink is to avoid resource-heavy and unoptimized websites,
while still allowing the user to enjoy various streamed content.
There is also an :ref:`API <api_guide:API Guide>` available for developers who want access
to the stream data.

Streamlink[-27] is a fork of the `Streamlink <https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink>`_ project.

The project extension [-27] indicates that this project continues to support python 2.7,
as the streamlink project has discontinued python 2.7 support as of version 1.7.0.

Features
--------

Streamlink is built upon a plugin system which allows support for new services
to be easily added. Most of the big streaming services are supported, such as:

- `Twitch.tv <https://www.twitch.tv/>`_
- `YouTube.com <https://www.youtube.com/>`_
- `Livestream.com <https://livestream.com/>`_
- `Dailymotion.com <https://www.dailymotion.com/live>`_

... and many more. A full list of plugins currently included can be found
on the :ref:`Plugins <plugin_matrix:Plugins>` page.
